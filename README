This is an easy backup system packaged and ready to use.

It uses rdiff-backup

  http://www.nongnu.org/rdiff-backup/

and create a dedicated user on the remote system with a ssh public key access.
Since there is the need to backup root owned files the remote user need the sudo

local system --- rdiff-backup ---> remote system --- rsync-checker ---> sudo rdiff-backup


First create the binary package

 $ fakeroot debian/rules binary
 # dpkg -i easy-backup.deb
 <insert public key and username for backup>


If you want to dump databases from the remote system, use the script
in /usr/share/easy-backup/conf/cron and decomment your choosen backend.

WARNING: installing manually the package (by dpkg) can cause an error,
it's possible to fix executing

 $ apt-get -f install
