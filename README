First create the binary package

 $ fakeroot debian/rules binary
 # dpkg -i easy-backup.deb
 <insert public key and username for backup>

In the system where you want to store the backups, create a rsnapshot
like the one stored at /usr/share/easy-backup/conf/rsnapshot.conf and
add a line in a crontab file in order to schedule it. Just this!

If you want to dump databases from the remote system, use the script
in /usr/share/easy-backup/conf/cron and decomment your choosen backend.

WARNING: installing manually the package (by dpkg) can cause an error,
it's possible to fix executing

 $ apt-get -f install

In order to test the connection you can use

 $ ssh backupuser@mydomain.com 'echo miao true'

and see if all is ok.
